				<p>On 2nd March 2021 St. Joseph's College celebrated 125 years. Tracing the College's origins and proud achievements, there isn't a better time to track 117 years of evolution, stemming from a seed sown by the then Archbishop of Colombo Rt. Rev. Dr. Christopher Bonjean in 1892 the idea of a Catholic College. Unfortunately the Most Rev. Fr. Bonjean did not live through to see his vision come alive. But the good York was carried out by Rev. Fr. Charles Collin and Rev. Fr. Charles Lyntten, both who went on to be Rectors of the College. The original plan was for the building of a Catholic College in a land at Mattakkuliya, which eventually evolved into the property at Darley Road as the chosen site. 12 acres as it stands now.</p>
				<p>With the foundation stone laid in December 1894, by the Papal Delegate for Asia, Rev. Msgr. St. Joseph's College, Colombo, was declared open on the 2nd of March 1896. From a humble beginning of an initial 211 students in the school proper and 96 students in the preparatory school, Rev. Fr. Charles Collin, quite fittingly was appointed the First Rector. The College building was formally declared open by Governor of Ceylon West Ridgeway and was blessed by Most Rev. Msgr. Zaleski, and the Archbishop Rt. Rev. Dr. Melizan OMI gracing the occasion.</p>
				<p>The Rector's office, the College office and the classrooms were all housed in the first building - the Clock Tower Building of the College, housing the classrooms, the Rector's office and the College offices. The College magazine was started in 1905. The Bonjean Hall was the third building to be completed, by Rev. Fr. Charles Lytten, the second Rector, a glowing tribute, perhaps the least, to Fr. Bonjean, a great visionary.</p>
				<p>Rector, Rev. Fr. Emil Nicholas OMI was the third Rector appointed in 1912. One of Rev. Fr. Emil Nicholas' greatest achievements was the creation of the first Religious Association of the College - the Guild of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, which most students past and present our proud members of.</p>
				<p>Four years later, in 1919, another legendary educationist, scientist and efficient administrator Rev. Fr. Maurice J. Legoc OMI was appointed the fourth Rector. Continuing the expansion to meet the growing demand for education, in 1933, the present Primary Building - originally named "The Maurice Block", became the newest addition. It was a replica of the Bonjean Hall adding symmetry aesthetics and architectural marvel to the sprawling facility. The next large expansion was the South Wing, a two-storied building to house classrooms. Being a scientist, Rev. Fr. Legoc in the 1930's could foresee the significance of Science in education and its role in a changing world. He took leadership in placing great emphasis on incorporating Science subjects into the curriculum As a Botanist, he published "Tropical Botany" a text that was widely known in Ordinary Level classes, both in India and Sri Lanka. Fr. Legoc was also responsible and introduced a scheme of scholarships for the under privileged students, making a difference to the lives of the needy and that of the future generations. Fr. Legoc's vision was to widen the provision of education, continuing to make a difference to the lives of those we had to reach. The initiative saw the birth of,</p>

				<p>On the feast of St. Joseph, 19th March 1929, the foundation stone for the College Chapel was laid by the Archbishop of Colombo, yet, another unrivalled architectural marvel, a building with splendour, no columns and acoustic brilliance, one of its kind, the very few in the world, even in today's day and age.</p>
				<p>Rev. Fr. Peter Pillai OMI was the fifth Rector, from 1940 to 1961, the first Sri Lankan, a great scholar widely respected in Asia. The Grotto at St. Joseph's, a replica of the Grotto in Lourdes, France, was built in 1940. The College buildings were taken over by the Army during World War II, but the institution continued education with branches housed in Homagama, Kelaniya, Gampaha and later at Borella.</p>

				<p>Fruits of virtue and knowledge Here we gather, peace and power Symbolished in yonder banner Floating o'er St. Joseph's tower White and blue its mystic colors Harmonizing strong and clear Stolen from the distant mountains From the wild waves breaking near From the wild waves breaking near, Harmonizing strong and clear White and Blue our mystic colors Till the mountains disappear.</p>
				<p>Where the peerless Pearl of Indies Hides Its glow on ocean's breast White and Blue is nature's setting To the gem she loves the best Closely clasped by silv'ry breakers Fretted from the flowing tide Round it heave the swelling billows Rolling blue o'er waters wide Fretted from the flowing tide Rolling blue o'er waters wide Fretted breakers, swelling billows White and Blue, the Ocean's pride.</p>
				<p>Where the Ard-righ of the mountains Gaurisanker, proudly reigns Round his throne a thousand vassals Fearless guardians of the plains Thunder back their monarch's greeting 'neath his canopy of blue Lightning-darts their quivers keeping Shining white their armours hue 'Neath his canopy of blue shining white their armours hue Snow-clad peak and bended heavens Keep aloft the White and Blue.</p>
				<p>Where our Lady, Queen of Heaven Deigned on earth to reappear In the grotto o'er the torrent from the mountains rising near, White and Blue her robe and girdle Lily white her mantle too Then we'll wear Our Lady's colours Dear St. Joseph's White and Blue Then Hurrah for White and Blue Then Hurrah for White and Blue, Still we'll wear Our Lady's colours Dear St. Joseph's White and Blue.</p>
